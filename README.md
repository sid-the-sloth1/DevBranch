- Main thing I wish to test is if records items recieved from Santa, games and chests.
- While CT is inactive the items recieved will not go to inventory, but the script will still record them. Make sure to delete the record of found items before CT actually starts. The script provides you ability to delete the items.
- If you use a key to open chest while CT is inactive, it will not consume the key, but the chest will be consumed.
